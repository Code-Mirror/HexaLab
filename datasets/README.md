# Datasets
This folder contains a collection of hexahedral datasets that have been presented in papers and made available by the respective authors. All the datasets are copyrighted by their authors. For any use different from displaying them inside HexaLab you should contact the authors. 
Current datasets came from the following papers:

- [All-Hex Meshing Using Singularity-Restricted Field (2012)](http://doi.org/10.1145/2366145.2366196)
- [â„“1-Based Construction of Polycube Maps from Complex Shapes (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1145/2602141)
- [Practical Hex-Mesh Optimization via Edge-Cone Rectification (2015)](http://doi.org/10.1145/2766905)
- [Efficient Volumetric PolyCube-Map Construction (2016)](http://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13007)
- [Skeleton-driven Adaptive Hexahedral Meshing of Tubular Shapes (2016)](http://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13021)
- [Structured Volume Decomposition via Generalized Sweeping (2017)](http://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2473835) 
## How to contribute
We really welcome datasets from existing papers, and we are collecting the ones we find available on the web. If you have some models related to a published paper you have two ways to contribute:
1) raise an [issue](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/HexaLab/issues) asking for a dataset/paper to be included providing doi of the paper and the link to the dataset; 
2) add it by yourself: clone the repo, add a folder a named as your paper with all the needed `.mesh` models, add an entry in the `index.json` file with all the needed info (title, authors, list of models, etc), and finally raise a pull request.
