# HexaLab
A online hexahedral mesh viewer.
Developed by [Matteo Bracci](https://github.com/c4stan) as part of his Bachelor Thesis in Computer Science, under the supervision of [Paolo Cignoni](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~cignoni) and [Nico Pietroni](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~pietroni) and with the help of [Marco Tarini](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~tarini/) e [Marco Livesu](http://pers.ge.imati.cnr.it/livesu/).

The system aims to offer a simple tool to view, inspect and check hexahedral models in the popular `.mesh` and `.vtk` ASCII formats directly in the browser. HexaLab offers interactive clipping planes, filtering and coloring by hex quality, histograms, singularity detections and visualization and screen space ambient occlusion for enhanced perception of shapes. 

HexaLab aims also to easily present the results of recent papers on hex meshing by directly including them in its own repository when provided by the authors. The datasets presented are copyrighted by the respective paper authors. Look in the [`datasets`](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/HexaLab/tree/master/datasets) folder for more info.
