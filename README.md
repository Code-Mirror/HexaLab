HexaLab is a WebGL application for real time visualization, exploration and assessment of hexahedral meshes. HexaLab can be used by simply opening www.hexalab.net. This visualization tool targets both users and scholars. Practitioners who employ hexmeshes for Finite Element Analysis, can readily check mesh quality and assess its usability for simulation. Researchers involved in mesh generation may use HexaLab to perform a detailed analysis of the mesh structure, isolating weak points and testing new solutions to improve on the state of the art and generate high quality images. To this end, we support a wide variety of visualization and volume inspection tools. The system offers also immediate access to a repository containing all the publicly available meshes produced with the most recent techniques for hexmesh generation. We believe HexaLab, providing a common tool for visualizing, assessing and distributing results, will push forward the recent  The system suppprts hexahedral models in the popular `.mesh` and `.vtk` ASCII formats. 

HexaLab aims also to easily present the results of recent papers on hex meshing by directly including them in its own repository when provided by the authors. The datasets presented are copyrighted by the respective paper authors. Look in the [`datasets`](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/HexaLab/tree/master/datasets) folder for more info.

HexaLab was initially developed by [Matteo Bracci](https://github.com/c4stan) as part of his Bachelor Thesis in Computer Science, under the supervision of [Paolo Cignoni](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~cignoni) and [Nico Pietroni](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~pietroni) and HexaLab has been developed to the current release status to the with the help of [Marco Tarini](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~tarini/) e [Marco Livesu](http://pers.ge.imati.cnr.it/livesu/).
